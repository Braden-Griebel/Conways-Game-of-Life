    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Conway's Game of Life!</h1>
    <div class="explanation-box">
        <p>
            Conway's Game of Life is a "cellular automata", made up of "alive" and
            "dead" cells, which are normally represented by black and white squares.
            At each step, alive cells can die, and dead cells can become alive according
            to four simple rules:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Even though the rules governing the simulation are really simple,
            remarkably complex behaviour can emerge, in fact Conway's Game of Life
            is Turing complete, so you can actually use it to do computations!
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you can play around with this deceptively simple game, and see what you
            discover. Click on cells left box to turn dead cells live, and live cells dead.
            You can adjust the field size and delay between steps in the simulation
            (click submit to apply changes). Finally hit start to see the simulation come to life!
        </p>

            Hope you enjoy!
